* Helper should have an associate_helper() method that calls driver.associate_helper(obj) (PARTIALLY DONE: see helper method in mondo_pizza/pizza_driver.rb)

* BLOCK_ASSERTIONS and ALLOW_MISSING_METHODS magic are stored
  in the proto/lib/test/system.rb file.
	Theory and usefulness of this feature are not definite, let's 
	leave it out until we need it.

	Existing pieces are:
	  Catchall
		Modification decl for Test::Unit::Assertions
		Some class vars on Systir:  
		  BLOCK_ASSERTIONS
			ALLOW_MISSING_METHODS

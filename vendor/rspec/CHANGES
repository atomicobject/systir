= RSpec Changelog

== Version 0.5.11
This release makes test2spec usable with Rails (with some manual steps). 
See http://rspec.rubyforge.org/tools/rails.html for more details

== Version 0.5.8
This release features a new Test::Unit to RSpec translation tool.

tests and have them run successfully!

* Updated test2spec documentation.
* Replaced old test2rspec with a new test2spec, which is based on ParseTree and RubyInline.

and addresses some bugfixes and changes to the spec commandline.

* Custom external formatters can now be specified via --require and --format.

== Version 0.5.6

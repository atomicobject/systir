h2. Underscore sugar

The internal implementation of RSpec actually uses chained method calls, so it's possible
to write:

<ruby>
lambda { 1.should.not.equal 1 }.should.raise
</ruby>

However, in order to make RSpec look and feel closer to other ruby code,
RSpec allows you to use underscores instead if you wish:

<ruby>
lambda { 1.should_not_equal 1 }.should_raise
</ruby>

Therefore, you will see the underscored syntax throughout the documentation and examples.

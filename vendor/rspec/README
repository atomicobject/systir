In order to run RSpec's tests and generate the website, you must have RubyGems.
Then you must install the following gems:

* rake
* rcov
* ParseTree   (Ignore the message: test/test_parse_tree.rb:190:38: ':' not followed by identified or operator)
* RubyInline
* webgen
* RedCloth
* syntax

Note that RSpec itself - once built - doesn't have any dependencies outside the Ruby core 
and stdlib - with a few exceptions:

* The test2spec command line uses ParseTree and RubyInline
* The Spec::Rake::SpecTask needs RCov if RCov is enabled in the task.

See http://rspec.rubyforge.org for further documentation.

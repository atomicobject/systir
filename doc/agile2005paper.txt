---+ Domain-Specific System Test Automation with SYSTIR
(summary)
In this paper we present a new system testing framework that encourages a handful of recent ideas in the realm of automated system testing.

---++ What we have now
(Intro, common tools)
Modern frameworks for automated system testing often fall into two categories.  Some are capture/replay-based systems that allow testing of applications by recording a users actions and allowing automated replay and verification of the results.  Other systems provide a vendor-specific language to write high-level scripts that describe system test cases.  Many are hybrids of the two, recording scripts using a high-level language that allows hand customization or even data-driven parameterization.

---++ What makes ruby a good choice
Ruby has become known for it's applicability in domain-specific languages.  Ruby's dynamic typing and object-oriented self-modification allows it's users to quickly create customized languages that read like natural language.  It's =perl=-inspired relaxed syntax allows for freedoms that aid in readability without sacrificing capability.  Optional semicolons and parentheses are an example of this.  Dave Thomas of the Pragmatic Programmers has highlighted Ruby's use as a generative language, saying "Ruby

---++ DSLs
(define, explain, applications)

Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are useful for describing a system test case in the language of the problem domain.  Using a general-purpose lanugage for such a task requires building libraries from scratch to support the language of the problem space.

As test-driven development gains support we see a slew of commercial testing tools that feature vendor-specific scripting languages.  These languages are typically hard to customize to specific applications.  They trade reduced customization for increased ease of use.

Creating a new domain language costs too much.  Buying an existing commercial testing tool that includes a domain-specific language is winning only half of the battle.  Many of these tools

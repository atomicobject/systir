Systir - System Testing In Ruby

To use Systir in your project, you merely need to have systir.rb in your load path at test execution time.

For now, the quickest way to get up and running is to peek at examples/basic/README.

Enjoy!

All forms of positive and negative feedback are most welcome.  We're hoping to provide rapid responses to inquiries and requests, so give us a try!

Thanks,
 - The Systir Team

This is an extremely basic sanity check that shows how you might set up an automated system test suite.

sanity.test
  The system test

run_test.rb
  Harness for launching a system test.  
  Execute by passing it the file name of a test, eg:
    bash$ ruby run_test.rb sanity.test

basic_driver.rb
  The implementation of the Systir::LanguageDriver for this test suite.
  This is where you define the language constructs needed by your tests.
  Systir drivers inherit semantics of a Test::Unit::TestCase; you may invoke
    assertions and utilize setup and teardown methods.
